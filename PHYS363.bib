  abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;We have analysed magnetic field fluctuations in sheath regions ahead of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (CMEs). CME sheaths are one of the key drivers of space weather disturbances, but their detailed structure and formation are relatively poorly understood. The level of magnetic field fluctuations in sheaths is generally much higher than in the ambient solar wind. We compare fluctuation properties in different parts of a sheath observed at the orbit of Earth using by the Wind spacecraft. Our findings show that in general the transition from the preceding solar wind to the sheath generates new fluctuations that are mostly compressive and which increase intermittency.\&amp;\#160; Spectral indices are mostly steeper than the -5/3 Kolmogorov index. The standard p-model did not show a good fit (in either the Kraichnan or Kolmogorov form), but the extended p-model was in a very good agreement. This suggests that turbulence may not be fully developed in CME sheaths in general. Our study also reveals that turbulent properties can vary considerably between different sheaths and in different subregions of the sheath, and can be significantly modified by the presence of small coherent structures. The findings support the view that sheath formation is a complex process with multiple physical mechanisms playing a role in generating the turbulence.\&amp;\#160;\&lt;/p\&gt;}

  abstract = {Abstract. The Danish school teacher Sophus Peter Tromholt (1851–1896) was self-taught in physics, astronomy, and auroral sciences. Still, he was one of the brightest auroral researchers of the 19th century. He was the first scientist ever to organize and analyse correlated auroral observations over a wide area (entire Scandinavia) moving away from incomplete localized observations. Tromholt documented the relation between auroras and sunspots and demonstrated the daily, seasonal and solar cycle-related variations in high-latitude auroral occurrence frequencies. Thus, Tromholt was the first ever to deduce from auroral observations the variations associated with what is now known as the auroral oval termed so by Khorosheva (1962) and Feldstein (1963) more than 80 yr later. He made reliable and accurate estimates of the heights of auroras several decades before this important issue was finally settled through Størmer's brilliant photographic technique. In addition to his three major scientific works (Tromholt, 1880a, 1882a, and 1885a), he wrote numerous short science notes and made huge efforts to collect historical auroral observations (Tromholt, 1898). Furthermore, Tromholt wrote a large number of popular science articles in newspapers and journals and made lecture tours all over Scandinavia and Germany, contributing to enhance the public educational level and awareness. He devoted most of his life to auroral research but as a self-taught scientist, he received little acclaim within the contemporary academic scientific society. With his non-academic background, trained at a college of education – not a university – he was never offered a position at a university or a research institution. However, Sophus Tromholt was an outstanding pioneer in auroral research.},
